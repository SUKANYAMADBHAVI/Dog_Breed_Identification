# Dog_Breed_Identification

The Dog Breed Identifier project is a computer vision project that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify the breed of a given dog image along with breedâ€™s information. The project has the potential to help dog owners identify their pet's breed with ease and accuracy. It can also be used by dog shelters and rescue centers to quickly determine the breed of the dogs they take in.
The project uses the Stanford Dogs dataset, which contains 20,580 images of dogs from 120 different breeds. The dataset is preprocessed using OpenCV to normalize the image pixel values and convert the images to grayscale. The preprocessed images are then used to train and validate the CNN model.
The CNN model is built using the Keras deep learning framework with TensorFlow as the backend. The model architecture consists of several convolutional layers, followed by max-pooling layers and a fully connected layer. Dropout regularization is used to prevent overfitting, and the model is trained using the categorical cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.
The trained model achieves a high accuracy of around 95% on the test set. The project is implemented as a web application using Flask, HTML, and CSS. Users can upload a dog image to the web interface, and the predicted breed and its information is displayed as the output.
Future improvements to this project could include the ability to identify mixed-breed dogs and to recognize multiple dogs in a single image. The Dog Breed Identifier project has potential applications in the pet industry, dog shelters, and rescue centers, and can be extended to other animal species as well.
